This GitHub repository is for convenience only.

The contents of each DEB package falls under the license respective to its original repository, as found under the GitHub user 'terminalforlife'. Use of each DEB package therefore comes with the same limitations described in the associated 'LICENSE' file.

Some versions of programs within this directory may not be the latest version available up one level, but the user may decide to install them manually. If you do, */usr/bin/* is the intended (but not required) destination, so ensure correct and safe permissions and ownship attributes of all transferred files.
