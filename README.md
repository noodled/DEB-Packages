**NOTE:** _All packages are built from master branches._

# Information

Thank you for checking out these Debian packages (info [here](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-pkg_basics.en.html)) I've built for Debian- and Ubuntu-based distributions of Linux. Continue reading to learn of anything worth mentioning here.

You'll find packages here typically (but not exclusively) from [Extra](https://github.com/terminalforlife/Extra) and [PerlProjects](https://github.com/terminalforlife/PerlProjects) repositories.

The packages here can be downloaded and installed with a one-liner in a terminal, or by using your browser then a utility like `gdebi` (info [here](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gdebi)) which has a GUI.

This GitHub repository is for convenience only.

The contents of each DEB package falls under the license respective to its original repository, as found under the GitHub user 'terminalforlife'. Use of each DEB package therefore comes with the same limitations described in the associated 'LICENSE' file.

Some versions of programs within this directory may not be the latest version available up one level, but the user may decide to install them manually. If you do, `/usr/bin/` is the intended (but not required) destination, so ensure correct and safe permissions and ownership attributes of all transferred files.
